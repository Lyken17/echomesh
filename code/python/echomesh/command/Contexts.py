In order to control multiple machines and configurations effectively, echomesh
configurations and scores live in one of five different types of "contexts".

default:
  This is the default context that comes with echomesh and contains only the
  default configuration, which cannot be changed by echomesh programs.

master:
  This is the master context which contains your master score.  Most of your
  work will be done here.

platform:
  The platform context contains scores that are specific to platform of the
  machine that echomesh is running on, i.e the operating system and hardware.

  Right now, we have three platforms:  linux, darwin and windows.

tag:
  At configuration time, you can specify text tags for each machine.

name:
  This directory contains scores that are only associated with a machine with
  the given name.
